One common case, and the default for DifferentialEquations.jl, is diagonal noise where ``g`` is a diagonal matrix. This means that every function in the system gets a different random number. Instead of handling matrices in this case, we simply define both ``f`` and ``g`` as in-place functions. Thus ``f(du,u,p,t)`` gives a vector of ``du`` which is the deterministic change, and ``g(du2,u,p,t)`` gives a vector ``du2`` for which ``du2.*W`` is the stochastic portion of the equation.\r\n",
